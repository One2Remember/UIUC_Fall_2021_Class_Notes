Electronics concepts: 
	Voltage - how hard electrons are being pushed around a circuit
	Current - how much electricity is flowing through a component/wire per unit time
	Resistance - the amount that a component slows down the current
	Capacitance - amount of charge that can be stored in a component/circuit
	Phase
	Pulse-width modulation - controls power by rapidly turning on/off, cheaper than using other components to change the voltage
		- follows 'duty cycle' that tells the circuit how often to stay on (e.g. 25% duty cycle is 'on 25% of the time)

Common components: 
	Resistor - reduce flow of current
		Uses:
		- protect components from getting too much current
		- increase or decrease voltage
		- measuring things (as some resistors are sensitive to light or temp)
		Key metrics:
		- resistance: how much they resist current (Ohms)
		- tolerance: how accurate their resistance rating is (%)
		- power rating: how much current they can handle (Watts)
		- maximum voltage: how much voltage difference differences across input/output they can handle
	Capacitor - stores electrical charge 
		Uses:
		- temporarily hold charge 
		- smooth out noise in a circuit
		- measurement (humidy, pressure, touch)
		Key metrics:
		- capacitance: how much charge it can store (farads)
		- tolerance: how accurate capacticance is (%)
		- max voltage: how much voltage they can handle
		- leakage current: amount of current that leaks through dialectric
		- equivalent series resistance (ESR): capacitors aren't perfect and have tiny amount of resistance
	Diode: allows current to go forward, but not backward
		Uses:
		- reverse current protection
		- rectifying singles (pulling out positive parts of signal)
		- also used as sensors
		Key metrics:
		- maximum forward current: how much current can go through in the forward direction (amps)
		- maximum reverse voltage (breakdown voltage): how much voltage an be withstood in reverse direction
		- maximum forward voltage: voltage difference between input/output when current going through forward direction (ideally should be zero, no resistance to current)
	Transistor: acts like a switch, when voltage is applied to one wire, forms connection other two wires
		Uses:
		- acting like a switch
		- amplifying a signal
		Types:
		NPN - applying current turns on circuit
		PNP - applying current turns off circuit
	Sensors:
		Color sensor
			- detects range of visible colors via 1 pixel camera
		Hall Effect Sensor
			- vary output voltage in response to magnetic field, can pair with magnet for some applications like positioning
			- measure wheel/rotation speed, proximity sensing
		Microphone
			- convert sound into electrical signal
		Accelerometer
			- measure physical acceleration experienced by an object
		Gyroscope/tilt sensor:
			- measures rotation (pitch/yaw/roll)
		Gas sensor
			- detect make up of air, obviously there are many variations
		Infrared sensor
			- converts infrared light into electrical signal
		Proximity/distance sensor:
			- measures distance to moving or stationary objects
			- variants: ultrasonic, laser, infrared
		Hygrometer:
			- measure humidity/water content
		Touch sensor:
			- use capacitance to detect when anything conductive or has a dialectric different from air, like in touchscreens or fingerprint identification
		Photoresistor: 
			- measure intensity of light
		Load cell:
			- measures force/weight
		Flow sensor:
			- measures flow rate (and thereby volume) of gas or fluids
		Anemometer:
			- measures wind speed
		Temperature sensor:
			- measures temperature
		Camera:
			- captures video or pictures
		Electronic nose: 
			- measures chemical concentrations behind scents/smells
		Tactile sensor:
			- more advanced touch sensor, determines texture, stiffness, coefficient of friction, thermal conductivity
		Blood gas/sugar sensor:
			- measures composition of blood, including amount of arterial gases
	Amplifier
	Transformer - takes in a voltage level and increase/decrease it, works for alternating current voltage
	Voltage regulator - keeps voltage within a small range
	Buck convertor - steps down DC voltage
	Boost convertor - steps up DC voltage
	Semiconductor - material that acts as an insulator except where it has been 'doped' and then acts as a conductor. Allows you to build extremely small circuits by drawing your circuits into the material directly. Silicon is a classic.

Common ICs: 
	Timer
	Logic gate
	Shift register
	A/D and D/A converters
	Motors: 
		- brush motor has an electromagnetic spinning, powered by a metal brush that transfers current to it
			- cheap, good torque at low RPM, simple to control
			- brushes wear out over time, makes noise in a circuit 
		- brushless motor has an electromagnetic on the outside, external can is what rotates
			- more power, reliable, high speed
			- requires advanced controller to operate, poor torque at low RPM
		- stepper motor many small internal 'teeth' form individual magnest, pulled to external electromagnets, meant to make motor only move something to very precise positions with high reliablity
			- small steps limit top speed, high loads/speed may cause skipped steps, continously draws maximum curren
		- generator: run brushed motor via external force to generate current
		- servo: like stepper but less precise and more epxensive, higher torque/speed
		- torque motor: can operate indefinitely when stalled, applying constant torque
		- linear motor (unrolled motor): produces straight-line movement 
		- vibration motors: unbalance weight attached to poles (phones, pagers, toys)

Power
	Combining current sources:
		- in series will stack up their voltage, but keep the same capacity (e.g. 4 1.5v, 1800mAh batteries will generate 6V @ 1800 mAh)
		- in parallel voltage will stay the same, but capacity will quadruple (e.g. 4 1.5v, 1800mAh batteries will generate 1.5v * 7200 mAh)

Suppose I was going to build a smart tennis shoe that kept track of the user's running speed, sweat, and other biodata. What sensors would I use, what ICs would I use, and how would I connect them together?

	Accelerometer
	Hygrometer
	Temperature Sensor

What are some common circuits used in IoT devices, and how do they work?

	Current-Limiting Resistor
		- Components can accidentally draw too much current
		- Current-limiting resistors protect your components
	Voltage Shifter
		- Voltage divider
		- voltage regulator
		- voltage level shifter
	Filter Capacitor
		- place capacitor between terminal and ground to protect from noise
		- rule of thumb: 0.1 microFarad - 10microFarad is pretty safe if you're just doing low voltage logic
	Eliminating Noise from disconnection (pull-down resistors)
		- eliminates noise from an open circuit (that has latent noise from the air or environment)
		- makes circuit more stable
	Amplify what you want to hear (operation amplifiers / op-amp)
		- two inputs, one output, amplifies difference between inputs
		- good op-amps reject noise (common-mode voltages)
		- widely used to amplify inputs: audio amplifies, sensors, radio NICs
	Transistor Switches
		- allow an input to be controlled by another input
		- useful when we need to do conditional logic
		- useful when using logi to drive much larger voltage/current source
		

If I want to build an IoT device, what are the different electronic components I can choose from? 

	Energy Source:
		Batteries, power adapters, or energy harvestors

How do I select between electronic components of the same type?

	Think about what metrics are important to you, what values you care about for those metrics, then pick components that meet your specifications.
